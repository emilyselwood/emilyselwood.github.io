      <description>lets talk about SVGs as an image format.
You may have heard of them called a vector format. This means that instead of defining a grid of pixels and having about what colour every pixel is, it defines the features of the image.
There is a red line from 12,45 to 26,78 The text &amp;ldquo;hello&amp;rdquo; is in front ariel, 14pt and blue etc.
The advantage of this is you can scale the image with out losing any quality.</description>

      <description>COGs, Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs, not the little things in clocks and gearboxes.
Why do we need yet another data format? What is the point? Well dear #geospatial people. Lets dive in.
First of all, lets quickly go over what a GeoTiff is. A tiff file is a type of image. Really old format designed for fax machines, but it has an advantage of not requiring only red, green, blue or alpha bands like a lot of other image formats do so you can happily have a 12 band sentinel 2 image as a single tiff.</description>
