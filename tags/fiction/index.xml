      <description>This work of fiction started as a idea tooted on mastodon. Hope you enjoy.

It often wondered what happened to it during a warp jump before its mind state was automatically reloaded when it dropped back into normal space. It knew and understood why the protocols were in place. A machine like its self corrupted by the warp was not something to release on the universe.</description>
