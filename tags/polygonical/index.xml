      <description>For the last ${scairy_number_of_years} years I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on some library tooling to create SVG files using rust. There are some libraries that existed already but they either didn&amp;rsquo;t work for what I needed to do or they had limitations. So I build two libraries of my own. Polygonical and ESVG. Polygonical focuses on 2d geometry operations. Points, lines, polygons and doing things to them. It does not concern its self with how they are shown, what format they are written to disk or anything like that.</description>
