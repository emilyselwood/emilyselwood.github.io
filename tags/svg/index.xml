      <description>I have some code that creates pages of shapes. My wife uses this to create products for her etsy shop. I originally wrote this in java many years ago. Some time last year I decided to rewrite the entire thing in rust. There were a number of reasons for this. Mostly that I&amp;rsquo;d learned a heck of a lot since I designed the original architecture and wanted some features that would not be possible with out rewriting most of it any way.</description>
