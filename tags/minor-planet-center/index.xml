      <description>In the last post we read the minor planet center orbit file. This was a JSON text file. This time we are going to look at a bit more complex file to process. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the first post in this series I recommend starting there before reading this.
In this post we are going to be looking at the Observation file. There are two parts to this file.</description>

      <description>Introduction A few weeks ago I saw comments between @Sondy and @JLGalache talking about getting a list of asteroids with their date of discovery. The main data file lists the year of discovery but not the actual date. I thought there was a way to get this information by looking at the observation file and joining it to the main data file. Todo this I decided to use Apache Spark.</description>
