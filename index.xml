      <description>I am a software engineer. Currently work at the Satellite Applications Catapult in Harwell, Oxfordshire. It is a great place to work. I get to be involved in some really interesting projects that help make the work a better place. Unfortunatly not all of them I can talk about.
I work with a wide range of tools. Mostly with a geographical or space side. Programming language wise I&amp;rsquo;m always happy to learn new things.</description>

      <description>Hello World I&amp;rsquo;m Wil Selwood. Every so often I get the urge to try and start a blog again. Here is iteration 235.
What do I do? I build systems for a living. Mostly data processing but I&amp;rsquo;ll happily get my hands dirty doing anything that needs to get done. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked many things from Unity and C# to C, Groovy, Go, Javascript, and Big data things like Accumulo and Spark.</description>
